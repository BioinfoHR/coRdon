Description: Tool for analysis of codon usage in various 
    unannotated or KEGG/COG annotated DNA sequences. 
	Calculates different measures of CU bias and CU-based
	predictors of gene expressivity, and performs gene set 
	enrichment analysis for annotated sequences.
	Implements several methods for visualization of CU
	and enrichment analysis results.
